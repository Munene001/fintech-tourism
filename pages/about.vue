        Our journey began with a frustration many travelers share: the joy of
        discovering Kenya often dimmed by the hassle of payments. We witnessed
        firsthand the stress of rejected cards at a remote lodge, the worry of
        carrying too much cash in a bustling market, and the confusion of
        fluctuating exchange rates. This wasn't the seamless adventure Kenya
        promised. We realized a $500M opportunity wasn't just economic; it was
        about reclaiming the magic of travel for you.
